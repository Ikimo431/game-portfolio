            <h2>Owen Johnston</h2>
          <p>I am a senior studying computer science at Carroll University, with minors in math and art. Programming is my strongsuit, 
            and I chose an art minor to broaden my skillset and improve one of my weak points in game development. This portfolio contains just my game work, for  
            more specific information on my skillsets and to see my non-game projects, view my full portfolio <a href='https://ikimo431.github.io/Portfolio-Site/index.html'>here.</a>
